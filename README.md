# hello-world
This is my first GitHub project as a beginner
Hello
My name is Hoang, I like math and programming. I have some basics of C#, C++, and Java. During the job hunter process, I realized that having experienced with version control (I never learned that in school) is a plus. So I decied to learn more about it as well as my coding skills by contributing some projects and get connected with many awesome enginneers out there. So excited ^^
